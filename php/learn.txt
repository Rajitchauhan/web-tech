PHP :
1 -> link to page (redirect) using anchor
2 -> if Statement (if : else: endif:) ,, we can use '{}'  also.
3 -> dynamic urls (in urls we can send the data), isset($_GET['name']) check data is sending or not.
4 -> htmlspecialchars() is a PHP function that is commonly used to convert special characters
 to HTML entities.
 This is particularly important
 when dealing with user input that will be displayed
 on a web page to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

5 -> Cookies in PHP are a way to store small pieces of information on the client's machine
 that can be retrieved later. Cookies are often used to store user preferences,
  session information, or other small amounts of data.

  A cookie is a small text file that is saved on the user’s computer.
   The maximum file size for a cookie is 4KB.
    It is also known as an HTTP cookie, a web cookie, or an internet cookie.
     When a user first visits a website,
  the site sends data packets to the user’s computer in the form of a cookie.

  6 -> session Session :
A session is used to save information on the server momentarily
so that it may be utilized across various pages of the website.
